# Grocery-Tracker
A tool to track data of groceries stored by a store. can be used to display item frequencies either in a singular format, show all items by frequency, as well as visualize the data with a histogram.
I recieved an A+ on this project, so I feel like the code was particularly efficient, readable, and followed common naming conventions so it was fairly easy to understand when reading as well as the user experience being relatively straightforward and errors were handled well. If I could enhance this project I would work on my current loop conventions and make the overall amount of code shorter and more efficient. I found the histogram visualizer to be the most difficult when writing this, as that was what I had the most trouble with visualizing and at times it would just display incorrectly, I had to spend most of the time I spent on this project making the histogram visualizer appear correctly with time and effort, along with a lot of help from resources like openstax. This project has improved my ability to make a "main" code as short and efficient as possible, and I will continue to use this format in my future work. I used common naming conventions, spacing and overall design referencing other projects I completed this semester in order to obtain all marks. I also put forward some common error trapping strategies to limit the amount of probnlems associated with user input.
